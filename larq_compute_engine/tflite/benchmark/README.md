# Benchmarking TF Lite

## Building the benchmark program

The benchmark program is automatically built with the larq compute engine.
Simply follow the build instructions in the [TF lite readme](../build/README.md).

## Running the benchmark

Simply run
```bash
./benchmark_model.sh
```
which will prompt to ask if the tflite model files should be generated in case it does not yet exist.

The tflite network will be generated by `benchmarknet.py`.

When new ops are added in the future, we can add them to `benchmarknet.py`.
