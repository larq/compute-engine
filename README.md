# Larq Compute Engine Guide

Larq Compute Engine (LCE) is a highly optimized inference engine for deploying
neural networks with exteremely low-precision weights and activations,
-such as Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs).
LCE provides a collection of hand-optimized [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 
and [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
custom Ops for specific instruction sets, developed in inline assembly or in C++ 
using compiler intrinsics. LCE leverages optimization techniques
such as **tiling** to maximize the number of cache hits, **vectorization** to maximize 
the computational throughput, and **multi-threading parallelization** to take
advantage of multi-core modern desktop and mobile CPUs.

## Key Features
- Tight integration of LCE with [Larq](https://larq.dev) and
  TensorFlow provides a smooth end-to-end training and deployment experience.
- LCE enables high performance, on-device machine learning inference by
  providing hand-optimized kernels and network level optimizations for BNN models.
- LCE currently supports ARM64-based mobile platforms such Android phones
  and the Raspberry Pi.
- Thread parallelism support in LCE is essential for modern mobile devices with
  multi-core CPUs.
- A collection of Larq pre-trained BNN models for common machine learning tasks
  is available in [Larq Zoo](https://github.com/larq/zoo)
  and can be used seamlessly with LCE.
- LCE provides a custom [MLIR-based model converter](./docs/mlir_converter.md) which
  is fully compatible with TensorFlow Lite and performs additional
  network level optimizations for Larq models.

## Performance
The table below presents **single-threaded** performance of Larq Compute Engine on multiple
generations of Larq BNN models on the [Pixel phone (2016)](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en-GB)
and (Raspberry Pi 4 [BCM2711](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711/README.md)) board:

Benchmarked on February, TODO with LCE custom
[TFLite Model Benchmark Tool](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/tools/benchmark)
(see [here](./larq_compute_engine/tflite/benchmark))
and BNN models with randomized weights and inputs.

## Getting started
Follow these steps to deploy a BNN with LCE:

1. **Building LCE**

    The LCE documentation provides the build instructions for [Andorid](./docs/quickstart_android.md)
    and [ARM64-based boards](./docs/build_arm.md) such as Raspberry Pi.
    Please follow the provided instructions to create a native LCE build
    or cross-compile for one of the supported targets.

1. **Pick a Larq model**

    You can use [Larq](https://github.com/larq/larq) to build and train your own
    model or pick a pre-trained model from [Larq Zoo](https://github.com/larq/zoo).

1. **Convert the Larq model**

    LCE is built on top of TensorFlow Lite and uses TensorFlow Lite
    [FlatBuffer format](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/)
    to convert and serialize Larq models for inference.
    We provide a [LCE Converter](./docs/mlir_converter.md) with additional
    optimization passes to increase the speed of execution of Larq models
    on supported target platforms.

1. **Run inference**

    LCE uses the [TensorFlow Lite Interpreter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/guide/inference.md) 
    to perform an inference. In addition to the already available built-in
    TensorFlow Lite Ops, optimized LCE Ops are registered to the interpreter
    to execute the Larq specific subgraphs of the model. An example to create
    and build LCE compatible TensorFlow Lite interpreter in user's applications
    is provided [here](./docs/inference.md).

## Next steps
- Explore [Larq pre-traind models](https://github.com/larq/zoo).
- Learn how to [build](https://larq.dev/guides/bnn-architecture/) and
  [train](https://larq.dev/guides/bnn-optimization/) BNNs for your own
  application with Larq.
